# Rat_Maze_hw

within LC3 Assemble course, we implemented a program that solve the rat maze game,
A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most
block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. 
A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down. 

In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used
in the path from source to destination.
our mission is to find and print all the possible paths from the source to the destination using 
backtracking.
